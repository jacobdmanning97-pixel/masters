\chapter{Notation}
For the remainder of the text, norms $\norm{\cdot}{D}$ are taken to be $\LP{2}{D}$ for the domain $D$. Inner products in $\LP{2}{D}$ are written $\IP{ \cdot,\cdot}{D}$, and the inner products $\LP{2}{\partial D}$ are written $\IP{ \cdot,\cdot}{\partial D}$. The space $\HM{s}{D}$ will denote the Sobolev space of order $s$, defined on a domain $D$, and $H_0^s(D)$ denotes the closure of $C_0^\infty(D)$ in the $\HM{s}{D}$ norm which we denote by $\norm{\cdot}{\HM{s}{D}}$ or $\norm{\cdot}{s,D}$. For the sake of simplicity, we denote 

\begin{align*}
    \textbf{L}^p(\Om_f)&=[\LP{p}{\Om_f}]^3,\:\textbf{L}^p(\Om_s)=[\LP{p}{\Om_s}]^3,\:\BFLP{p}{\G_s}=[\LP{p}{\G_s}]^2,\\
    \BH^s(\Om_s)&=[\HM{s}{\Om_s}]^3,\:\BH^s(\G_s)=[\HM{s}{\G_s}]^2.
\end{align*}

Also, we make use of the standard notation for the trace of functions defined on a Lipschitz domain $D$; i.e. for a scalar function $\phi\in\HM{1}{D}$, we denote $\gamma(w)$ to be the trace mapping from $\HM{1}{D}$ to $\HM{1/2}{\partial D}$. That is, $\gamma(w)=w|_{\partial D}$, for $w\in C^\infty(D)$. We will also denote pertinent duality pairings as $(\cdot,\cdot)_{X\times X'}$.
